WHY DID I CREATE THIS DOC

This is a place for my public work-in-progress writing. 

I will figure out what to put in the readme once I've used this to do my writing that I don't mind being public. 

It's hard to know what to put in the readme before I know exactly what I intend to put in this project. 

All I know is that Git and Github seem very useful for writing and I write a lot. 
I like branching off my thoughts and create so many versions of drafts, it'd be nice to have a less messy way of organizing all the versions for myself.
I also like writing collaboratively a lot.
I want more of my writing to be public too because that means that I'll have tighter feedback loops. 
Sharing work publicly is scary though so this feels like a great way to ease into it. This is clearly just work-in-progress.
